\item [{Toll~tag}] A toll tag is a physical device which will admit passage
through an express lane when equipped on a vehicle. Toll tags need

card lane, and are valid for 24 hours.

reports}, as well as view and modify customer data.

purchased single tickets and used toll tags, along with the type of
