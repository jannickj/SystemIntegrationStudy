In the following sections we will describe and explain our component diagrams, as well as how the different components interact throughout the system.

\subsubsection*{Enterprise server}
In \autoref{fig:ComponentDiagram_Enterprise} we show the simple component diagram for the enterprise server, along with the most macroscopic view of our system.

\subsubsection*{Toll station}
The component diagram for the toll station is shown in \autoref{fig:ComponentDiagram_TollLaneToStationAndEnterprise}. The toll station component contains the toll lanes and the toll station server component. The lanes communicate with the enterprise server through the toll station server component. Toll stations primarily need to send toll tag data and data for the reports the enterprise manager can generate.

\subsubsection*{Toll lanes}
In \autoref{fig:ComponentDiagram_TollLane} we show the components that make up the toll lanes. In the diagram four main components are shown: Express Check-in Toll Lane, Express Check-out Toll Lane, Normal Check-out Toll Lane and Normal Check-in Toll Lane. These components describe the software present in the different kind of toll lanes, as well as how they interface with their needed hardware components, such as Antenna and Ticket Reader. It also shows how the components interface with different actors. Interfaces to the other parts of the system are split up and described in other diagrams to reduce the complexity of this diagram.
