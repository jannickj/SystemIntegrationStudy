\section{Experience with the project}
\paragraph{What was learned}
We learned the process of how to take the descriptions of a large system, and use that to generate diagrams which progressively got us closer to our target product. We also learned in finer details how some of the diagrams works. 

\paragraph{What was good}
In our opinion all of our material is equally solid.
