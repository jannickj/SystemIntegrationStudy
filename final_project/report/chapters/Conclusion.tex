\section{Experience with the project}
We learned the process of how to take the descriptions of a large system, and use that to generate diagrams which progressively got us closer to our target product. We also learned some of the finer details of how the different kinds of diagrams work. We learned from experience that a more agile approach to the design phase of a system really is a good thing, as we refined the design a lot during this project, and such refinements could definitely come in handy in actual software projects. We are quite happy with how clear the it would be to implement the system after this design phase, but some of the diagrams don't really seem to provide a lot of details on the system. This is especially true for some of the protocol state machines, as they are too simple to be actually useful for anything other than busy-work, at least in this project.
