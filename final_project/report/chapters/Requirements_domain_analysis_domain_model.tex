In our domain model in {\autoref{fig:domain_model}}, a computer at each toll lane controls all the components that are part of that lane. All these lane computers are connected to a station server which controls what goes on at the station. All of the stations for the entire system are in turn connected to a single enterprise server which manages communication between the stations. Each lane, as well as the enterprise server, has a connection to the bank which is used in the sale of tickets and toll tags.
