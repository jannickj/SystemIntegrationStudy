\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Usability requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Customers in a normal lane must be able to pay for a ticket (in a check-in lane) or check out a ticket (in a check-out lane), and thereafter drive through the lane, in at most 2 minutes. If the customer requires help from the cashier then the constraint is relaxed to 5 minutes.
\item Customers must be able to drive through an express lane in at most 15 seconds.
\item Cashiers must be able to use the toll lane computer after 2 hours of training with at most 1 error per hour.
\item Enterprise managers must be able to use the station client after 5 hours of training with at most 1 error per hour.
\end{enumerate}


Performance requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Toll tags must be recognized at express lanes in at most 5 seconds.
\item Each toll lane and toll station computer should have an up time of 99.9\%.
\item The enterprise server should have an up time of 99.99\%.
\item The time for the system to generate reports for a single toll station must not exceed 1 minute.
\item Every other administrative tasks must not exceed 30 seconds of computation time.
\end{enumerate}
