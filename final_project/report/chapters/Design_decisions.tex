\subsection{Bidirectional stations}
The toll stations are designed to have both check in and check out, meaning that the motorway the station is placed upon is a motorway with lanes in both directions.

\subsection{Storing tags and tickets}
Whenever a customer checks in or out of a toll lane, the ticket or tag information is stored at different locations in the system. Every station server maintains a database which can be queried for check-ins, check-outs and ticket sales given a time period. This is used for reporting statistics. The enterprise server contains information about the currently valid toll tags and tickets. When a ticket is used for checking out a vehicle, or when it is 24 hours old, it is removed from the enterprise server. Since a customer normally checks out at a station different from the one he checked in at, this information needs to be shared on the enterprise server.
