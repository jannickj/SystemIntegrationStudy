In this report we document our work on modelling a motorway toll system consisting of a number of toll stations connected to a central server. The design of our system went through several phases. The first phase was about understanding the project, which was achieved by making a domain model sketch, and then using that to construct our use case diagram and formulate use cases. We chose our use cases such that they form a complete working system. In terms of methodology we went with a semi-agile approach and started by implementing three of the use cases. Once those were completed we went on with another three use cases, and from that we could finalize our design. The reason for this choice is that we did not feel that working on one use case was enough to occupy six people, so we split into pairs that worked on one use case each.

For planning and delegation of tasks we decided to use Trello which is an online implementation of a kanban board. This allowed us to visualize and organise the workflow of our project.
