The design of our system went through several phases. The first phase was about understanding the project, which was achieved by making a domain model sketch. From this we could then construct our use case diagram and begin to formulate some use cases. We tried to choose our use cases such that they form a complete working system. We went with a semi-agile approach and started by implementing three of the use cases. Once those were completed we went on with another three use cases, and from that we could finalize our design.
